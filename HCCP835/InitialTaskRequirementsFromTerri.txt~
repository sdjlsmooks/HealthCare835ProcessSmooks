File is flat file of rejection code,

send the rejection code back to next gen via the 835.
put the 

If the 837 is accepted, the 835 creates an adjustment code called payment code.
And it attaches the dollar amount that was on the original service.
The charge amount is in the flat file.

We need an 835 that links the payment to the encounter number.

If there is a rejection, the payment and the encounter goes into the 835l

Need an 835 created with the data that lives in the mockingbird file.

Claim number is actually the client ID. -- column AL in Beacon_FlatFileLayout_20201119_NEW_NPI_SPEC_Draft.xlsx

Flat file layout is in:

Questions:
   1.)  What are holds, duplicates, eligibility an mod files/entries?
   2.)  What/where are the RA4.enc files?
   3.)  What/where are the CPTFIXED_RA4 files? 
   4.)  What/where are the RA4_INDIGENT_FIXES files?
   5.)  What/where are the MEDRA4 files?
   6.)  CATCH_UP files?
   7.)  LOSTANDFOUND


In the files ???RA4enc_SP???RA4enc_???_Output files the Claim# is medical record number in NextGen.
Member Number is Medicaid ID.

I am going to have to match on encounter ID  (encounter is the link to the encounter ID in NextGen).
Then the error number is going to match the Beacon Error codes to X12 error codes.
So for example if the Beacon error code is 93, then use the crosswalk mapping to X12 error
code PI18.


What I may need to do is have it be a nightly process that looks in the 
table/view from the query for a file with the timestamp of <today>

select from Table DWH.dbo.HS_Encounters where FileName like MEDRA4 with ts  = todays date

   Select * from DWH.dbo.HS_Encounters where FileName = 'SP20200902_MEDRA4deb Test_RA4.ENC'

From that query, then find out what has been removed via this query:

   Select * from DWH.dbo.HS_Encounters where FileName = 'SP20200902_MEDRA4deb Test_RA4.ENC'


For records that have not been removed, send in an 835 marked as a payment.

For records that have been removed (payment has been ACCEPTED)., send in an 835 rejection code.
